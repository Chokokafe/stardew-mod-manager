This app is an app for those who don't want to spend their time on finding their missing dependencies or updates.
Just click on the button "Extract files", Select your folder with the mod files and boom ! Your actual mods and missing mods will be showed on the following windows.
Your mods are extracted on the folder "extracted", at the root of the exe file

# TODO

- Make the path to extracted mods customizable too
- Make a better look for the UI
